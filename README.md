Scritp that check an email account for messages and can trigger actions acording to instructions in these messages

I have plenty access to mail and google, but I can't browse Internet, due this I usually receive a bunch of links or I can search something in google, but I can't browse the google results, this is the reason to create a script that does the following:

This script can be executed periodically in a server/pc, it will check an email account and open the older of all the unread messages, extract the commands on it and trigger an action.

Right now it can only download a file or a web page, there is a lot to do.

Even though right now this script workis, it's in an early stage since I have some kind of recursive problem, I can't browse Internet to learn more python and then code this script, and I do not know enouth python to code this script and then have access to Internet pages.

ToDo
*Download "full" sites rescusively
*Read body of messages so It can receive multiple instructions in the same message
*Open all unread messages on a single execution
